# Portfolio Website Description

## Purpose

My full-stack website portfolio aims to showcase my skills, experience, and expertise as a web developer, serving as a comprehensive digital resume for potential employers, recruiters, and clients. With a visually appealing and user-friendly design, it effectively communicates my skills, projects, and accomplishments, leaving a positive and lasting impression on visitors.

Ultimately, my portfolio website serves as a platform to establish credibility and gain the attention of potential employers and clients. It will effectively convey my qualifications, educational background, and relevant experiences to position myself as a sought-after full-stack web developer. To facilitate this process, I will ensure that my contact information is readily available, enabling interested parties to easily reach out to discuss potential employment or collaboration opportunities.

## Functionality / Features

There are 5 'main' 'parent' webpages within my website they are;

 - The `about.html` page which is a summary of myself and also has a link to my [resume](/src/assets/LewisHardie_Resume.pdf). 
 - The `projects.html` page is a collection of my recent projects, which will be external links the project itself, once I have 'projects' to put up. 
 - The `contact.html` page is a collection of information about myself and links relevant social/tech profiles, as well as a contact form. 
 - The `blog.html` is a list of blogs that have been written, each blog then links to a 'child' page.
 - The `index.html` page is the landing page for the website, this contains a link to my [resume](/src/assets/LewisHardie_Resume.pdf) and a link to my [E-mail](mailto:lewishardie@gmail.com), which allows anyone coming to the website for the first time, to get in contact quickly, the page also contains small snippets from the other 'main' pages for quick perusal and then navigation to those pages, if required.


### Navigation

Each page has a header navigation  at the top and footer navigation at the bottom, I initially considered fixing the header to the top of the page, so that as you scrolled down any page you'd have access to the header navigation, however I found this to get in the way. The header navigation is used to move between each of the 'parent' or 'main' pages. The footer navigation has all the external social links, along with a link to my resume and my email, to make it easy for potential empolyees to get in contact.

### Responsive Layout

Whilst creating the website, I made sure to use CSS Flex Box, and the appropiate sizing units i.e. `rem` or `%` to enable the website to scale up and down appropriately as much as possible.

This sizes that the website have been tested on are as follows;

- Desktop
    - 1440p (2560 x 1440)
    - 1080p (1920 x 1080)
    - 720p (1280 x 720p)

- Mobile

    - Iphone SE (375 x 667)
    - Iphone 12 (390 x 844)

- Ipad
    - Ipad Mini (768 x 1024)
    - Ipad Air (820 x 1180)

### Design

All the pages throughout the website have been styled and structured consistently where possible. This has been achieveed by using consistent spacing between elements and compoents, structuring the size elements and componenets to be the same keeping colour schemes and usage consisteny between the elements and componenets, creating a font-heirachy and using appropriately.

## Sitemap

Below is the sitemap I made for the website, I've tried to be as clear as possible in indicating the different external and internal navigation. There

## Target Audience

The target audience for my full-stack web developer portfolio website is primarily composed of potential employers, hiring managers, and recruiters from companies seeking skilled full-stack developers. These individuals will be evaluating my website to assess my technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and overall expertise in both front-end and back-end development.

Going forward I will be aiming to continious updated my website with projects that demonstrate my ability to create responsive and intuitive user interfaces, as well as showcasing my back-end development skills in areas such as database design, API integration, and server-side logic. Once I have a bit more experience I'll also be including information about the frameworks, libraries, databases, and tools that I will have had experience with, along with any notable projects or contributions that I've made. I'll intend to emphasize my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and my ability to collaborate effectively within a team. 

I've it easy for visitors to contact me by including clear contact information and a contact form on the landing page.
